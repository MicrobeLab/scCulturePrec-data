All the morphological and spectral data are available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/s/260533c8d814c10e9c54). The morphological data are also provided in the `morphol` directory above. 

The columns in the morphological data tables, in order, are: area, width, length, aspect ratio, eccentricity, circularity, convexity, extent, perimeter, centroid. 

The spectral data tables included integrated area (Â±10 cm-1) from 600 cm-1 to 3000 cm-1.
